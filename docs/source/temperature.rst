Procedure for creating temperature and elevation figures
========================================================

Creating the figure included in the manuscript that shows glacier area change with changes in temperature and elevation leveraged outputs of the 
GlacierCoverNet model and temperature data from the Daymet dataset (Thornton et al, 2020).
